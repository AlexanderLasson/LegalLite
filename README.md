legalite

Overview

The legality program is a Django-based application designed to analyze and evaluate Terms of Service (TOS) agreements. It provides users with a comprehensive assessment of the legitimacy of TOS agreements, assigning them a score and color-coding (red, green, or yellow) based on their level of clarity.


Implementation

Implemented features such as user registration, profile management, TOS submission, comparison, and search functionality. Integrated spaCy for automated annotation of TOS submissions, enhancing the efficiency of identifying specific legal clauses. Utilized Django forms for user interactions, enabling users to submit, edit, and compare TOS agreements. Implemented a community ranking system for TOS submissions, allowing users to rate and contribute to the ranking of TOS agreements. Ensured a user experience with responsive and interactive web pages.
