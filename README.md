legalite

Overview

The legality program is a Django-based application designed to analyze and evaluate Terms of Service (TOS) agreements. It provides users with a comprehensive assessment of the legitimacy of TOS agreements, assigning them a score and color-coding (red, green, or yellow) based on their level of clarity.

Features

Legitimacy Scoring: The program employs an algorithm to evaluate the legitimacy of TOS agreements. The resulting score determines the color-coded rating (red, green, or yellow) displayed to users.
User Contributions: Registered users can contribute to the platform by submitting new TOS agreements. Each submission undergoes a legitimacy assessment and is added to the database.
Comparison Tool: Users can compare multiple TOS agreements to identify differences and similarities, aiding in decision-making.
User Profiles: Registered users have access to a profile page where they can view and edit their information. The profile also displays TOS agreements and edits contributed by the user.
Community Ranking: Users can provide community rankings for TOS agreements, contributing to the overall legitimacy score.
