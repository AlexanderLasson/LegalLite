# LegaLite: Simplifying Terms of Service Analysis



Welcome to LegaLite, a powerful tool developed during my college years to simplify the understanding of complex Terms of Service agreements. LegaLite is built using the Django Python framework, incorporating HTML and JavaScript to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Features

### 1. **Upload and Scan TOS Agreements**

Easily upload your Terms of Service agreements through LegaLite's intuitive interface. Once uploaded, our program efficiently scans the document for vague terms and provides detailed explanations, making legal jargon more accessible.

### 2. **Color-Coded Analysis**

LegaLite goes beyond simple explanations by visually representing the complexity of different segments in the Terms of Service. Using a sophisticated algorithm, detected segments are color-coded, helping users quickly identify the simplicity or complexity of each section.

- **Green:** Simple and straightforward terms
- **Brown:** Moderately complex terms
- **Red:** Complex and potentially confusing terms

### 3. **Database Storage**

All analyzed data, including uploaded Terms of Service agreements and their corresponding analyses, is securely stored in the LegaLite database. This ensures easy retrieval of information and enables users to track changes over time.

### 4. **Community Score**

LegaLite encourages community engagement by introducing a scoring system for uploaded Terms of Service agreements. Users can contribute to the community score, rating the clarity and fairness of the terms. This collaborative approach enhances the overall usefulness and reliability of the analyzed data.
